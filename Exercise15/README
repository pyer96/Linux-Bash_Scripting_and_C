This script accepts at most 3 arguments from CLI
and saves the number of arguments received in the 
environmental variable N in the current shell's env.

In particular the script, instead of exporting the variable
in its temporary and closed scope environment makes the parent 
process (the shell) execute the export command so that the N variable
will be available, untill shell is open, in the parent environment.
No .bashrc is touched. No source command needed. 
-> just need to execute inside $(...)
